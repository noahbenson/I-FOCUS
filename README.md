## Organization

This repository contains a few folders, each of which document specific
processes and tools used in the project:

* **`hyak`**. The `hyak` directory documents the project's use of the University
  of Washington's [Hyak](https://hyak.uw.edu/) compute cluster. The scripts in
  this folder are meant to be run on Hyak and thus typically require access to
  it. Researchers who are new to the project and have access to Hyak should use
  the instructions in this folder to configure their Hyak home directories.
* **`preprocessing`**. The `preprocessing` folder contains preprocessing scripts
  and documentation of our preprocessing pipeline.
* **`analysis`**. The `analysis` folder contains analysis code and visualization
  notebooks for the project.
